// The dpi pane fit: the figure is fitted to the output pane by scaling
// figure.dpi with figsize FIXED, so the picture is the same composition at a
// different scale and the download never depends on the browser window.
//
// These read window.__trinketPaneFit, the probe pyodide.js exposes for them.
// That matters: the failures this guards against look FINE in a screenshot.
// figsize drifting a few hundredths of an inch per fit, or a classifier calling
// a student's drag an echo, are invisible until someone downloads a file or
// resizes twice -- so the assertions are on the classifier's own decisions and
// on Python's numbers, not on pixels alone.
//
// Both runtimes, because they diverge: the worker's round trip is asynchronous
// and its toolbar carries Font Awesome glyphs, while the main thread's is
// synchronous with matplotlib's own PNG icons. Every bug below appeared on one
// and not the other.
//
// dpr is whatever the browser gives. Playwright's emulated deviceScaleFactor
// does NOT drive devicePixelContentBoxSize, so a dpr-2 run means a HEADED
// Chrome on a retina panel -- the assertions here are written to hold at any
// density rather than to pin one.

// THE ENCLOSING TEST BUDGET. `playwright.deploy.config.js` -- the config that
// owns this directory -- caps a test at 90_000, and every `runFigure` here waits
// up to 240_000 for the program to finish. Without this line the TEST dies at
// 90 s and a cold Pyodide download is reported as "the figure never appeared":
// the assertion that names what a student did not see never gets to run.
//
// Never measured here, and said plainly: this suite passes under the 90 s cap on
// a warm local stack in 2.8 minutes, slowest test 23.9 s, and a deliberate 20 s
// cap did not kill it either. localhost serves Pyodide from cache. The 240 s
// waits exist for the REMOTE baseURL this config actually defaults to, on a cold
// server, which is the case no run on this machine can produce.
//
// 360_000 and not 240_000: the value has to EXCEED the largest assertion timeout
// in the tests it covers, not equal it. At an equal budget the test cap fires at
// the same instant and you get "Test timeout of 240000ms exceeded" instead of
// the message naming the symptom -- the same defect in weak form.
//
// Two blocks below raise it further because they run the program TWICE, so two
// 240 s waits can serialize inside one test. Lowering either of those back to
// this value would put them exactly where this line found them.
//
// Cost: `retries: 1` makes a genuine failure cost 2x the budget. That is the
// right trade for a suite no workflow runs (#293). Repo-wide version is #302;
// the same fix landed on feat/mathoutput-worker in 4a31d33.

  // delivery is handled as an ordinary one, and the student is left looking at
  // a blank figure: two clicks and the plot is gone.
  //
  // WHAT DETECTS IT, AND IT IS NOT THE CLASSIFICATION. Measured by deleting the
  // branch from the served tree: the re-delivery is classified `echo`, not
  // `drag`, on BOTH runtimes -- so a test asserting "nothing was read as a
  // drag" passes with the bug present. The observable is the figure itself.
  //
  //   with the branch      ink 196992, 196992, 196992   reshow:513x384 each time
  //   branch deleted       ink 196992, 0, 0             echo:513x384 each time
  //
  // Hence `ink`: a count of non-transparent pixels on the mpl canvas, which a
  // reset bitmap reads as exactly 0. Symptom first; the reshow note is asserted
  // second, as the mechanism behind it.
  //
  // TWICE, not once. The shipped behaviour before 7d57c8f ALTERNATED between
  // ratcheting and blanking, so a single switch can land on the good half of an
  // alternation and report nothing wrong.
  //
  // THIS TEST PINS THE BRANCH'S PLACEMENT AS WELL AS ITS EXISTENCE, and an
  // earlier version of this comment claimed it did not. Moving the block below
  // the echo branch and running this test unmodified gives ink 196992 -> 0 at
  // the first tab switch on both runtimes -- identical to deleting the branch.
  // The reason is that an ordinary re-show has no gesture behind it, so
  // seq === seqAtFit and the echo branch would catch the re-delivery first,
  // mark it trinket_fit_echo and have Python drop it.
  //
  // The claim that it was unpinnable came from one measurement that began with
  // a CORNER DRAG -- the single path where seq !== seqAtFit, so the echo branch
  // does not catch it and the move really is harmless. Generalising from the
  // narrow case to the common one is the whole of that error, and the data
  // refuting it was already in this file's own mutation run.
  //
  // WHAT EACH ASSERTION BELOW PINS, since the three mechanisms in that branch
  // are separable and two earlier versions of this comment ran them together:
  // the ink pins the branch EXISTING and sending refresh; the reshow count
  // plus the ink pin its PLACEMENT above the echo branch; and the total note
  // count pins the `return`, which nothing else here can see.
  //
  // ONE THING IS NOT PINNED AND CANNOT BE. That a re-show must not update
  // `lastDelivered` is unobservable from outside: the branch only fires when
  // lastDelivered already equals the delivered size, and nothing can mutate st
  // between the comparison and the assignment, so assigning would write the
  // value it holds. That is a no-op rather than a mechanism.
