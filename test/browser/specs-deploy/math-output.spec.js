// Typeset SymPy output (#240), against a real deploy.
//
// The unit tests cover the AST wrap and the classifier as pure functions. What
// they cannot show is the thing the feature IS: that a bare SymPy expression
// becomes rendered mathematics in a browser, in order with print output. That
// needs Pyodide, SymPy and KaTeX all actually loading.
//
// NO SPEC IN THIS FILE PINS A RUNTIME. Every navigation goes to a bare
// /embed/python3, so the suite exercises whichever runtime the deploy defaults
// to, and one CI deploy proves one side. The specs that say "on both runtimes"
// are claims earned across two runs, neither of which proves them alone. Both
// were done by hand on 2026-09-18: this file as committed against a worker
// deploy (6 passed), and the same assertions against ?runtime=main by
// TEMPORARILY pointing these navigations at it (6 passed). The second is
// evidence about the assertions, not about this file as CI would run it --
// nobody has run it against a main-thread deploy. Note also that the `worker`
// flag below is read from the served HTML, so it reports the DEPLOY's default
// and would still say
// "WORKER deploy" for a spec that forced ?runtime=main.
//
// Skips unless features.mathOutput is on, so it is inert on deploys that have
// not enabled it. It NO LONGER skips on worker deploys: #288 implemented the
// worker half, and this spec is the positive control for it. Before #288 the
// skip was hiding the one place the feature was broken — flag-on and flag-off
// produced identical output there, so nothing could tell.

  // test/browser/playwright.deploy.config.js -- the config that owns this

  // this line the test is killed at 90 s and a matcher waiting 180 or 240 never
  // gets there. A slow Pyodide download then reports as a failure rather than
  // as a slow download. specs-deploy/step-debugger.spec.js:59 raises it for the
  // same reason and says so at :50-58.
  //
  // That config also sets expect: { timeout: 20_000 }, which is why every long
